<h1>Abstract</h1>
<h2>Biomolecule-based nanostructures are of great interests in bio-nanomaterial design due to their rich structural diversity and inherent biocompatibility. Among them, cyclic peptides have received remarkable attention owing to their rigid configuration as well as chemical and enzymatic stability. To date, previous reports have mainly focused on the construction of nanotubes in a ring-stacking manner through hydrogen bonding. However, other assembling strategies have rarely been explored. In this work, two cyclic peptides, cyclo-(DP)3 and cyclo-(DG)3, have been rationally designed and used as building blocks to fabricate novel assemblies. Nanovesicles and nanotubes were successfully constructed by crosslinking cyclo-(DP)3 with hexamethylendiamine or cyclo-RR based on covalent bonding or electrostatic interaction. To further explore its potential application in nucleotide delivery, plasmid DNA and oligoRNA were successfully bound to the vesicles and the latter was taken into the cell. On the basis of this result, more complex functions, such as gene delivery and targeted siRNA delivery, are expected to achieve with these cyclic peptide assemblies.</h2>

<h1>Project</h1>

<ul>
  <h2><li>Background</li></h2>
 <p>Building really small things is typically extremely hard; however since the development of the DNA origami technique a new world of opportunity has been opened. DNA origami allows scientists to relatively easily build arbitrary shapes and 3-dimensional structures on the nanoscale – some examples of these are shown below.For more information of the DNA origami technique see DNA design. There are many applications for this technology; however one of the most interesting opportunities which emerged early on was the prospect of developing nanoscale vessels which could deliver molecular cargo. The series of events unfolds as follows: a vessel is loaded with the cargo, the vessel is delivered, and then a release mechanism unloads the cargo.DNA origami has been used to not only just capture and release cargo, but to autonomously target selective cells and release the contents directly to the target site via logic-gated mechanisms. </p>
  <h2><li>The problem</li></h2>
  <p>The process of targeted delivery can be broken down into three steps: loading the vessel with the drug of interest, recognising the target site, and releasing the payload directly at that site. As shown above with Douglas et al. and Ranjbar et al., effective vessels have already been developed, but thus far the method of loading the cargo is limited to chemically binding it to the vessel.</p>

<p>What if we could load a vessel with an unbound payload? So that when delivered rather than remaining attached to the vessel the cargo is free to diffuse out and perform its function. Would the free cargo be more effective compared to a bound cargo? Could it fit into smaller spaces and perform unique tasks that were previously unachievable due to being bound to the vessel?</p>

  <p>What if we could take it a step further and build a vessel which was selectively responsive to autonomously loading a particular cargo? Could that lay the foundation for a new generation of smart drug delivery vessels which can not only selectively unload their cargo, but can also identify free cargo in solution and load it?</p>
  <h2><li>Our solution</li></h2>
  <p>These are interesting questions to ask, but for the sake of practicality they should be considered one at a time. First, we needed to ask if it were possible to capture any molecular cargo unbound inside a vessel.</p>

<p>Capturing unbound cargo isn’t a trivial task. Resorting to probability and locking a vessel at an arbitrary time and hoping to capture a particle is a poor strategy due to the enormous dispersity of particles in solution relative to the confined cavity space of most vessels.</p>

<p>The only alternative, we found, was to design a vessel which could actually be triggered to close by the proximity of the target molecule. After hundreds of bad drawings and a few late nights on caDNAno, out popped our design (which ended up looking a lot like a mousetrap.)</p>

  <p>This is a good solution because it proposes a way to potentially capture a specific unbound molecular cargo inside of a DNA origami vessel, which due to the nature of DNA origami structures could be easily modified with receptors to mediate targeting to diseased cells and deliver a payload.</p>

<p>Even with the application of targeted delivery aside, capture of free molecules inside of molecular cages has proved to be a significant challenge and this project offers a novel solution. This design also creates opportunity for research and discovery regarding the mechanical properties of spring-loaded DNA origrami structures, such as torsional and longitudinal stiffness.</p>
  <h2><li>Project goal</li></h2>
<p>here is a trade-off between choosing goals that are realistic in the short timeframe of BIOMOD and which are also scientifically significant and exciting. The prospect of developing new DNA origami vessels which can selectively capture unbound molecular cargo is one which can be explored in many directions, but for this competition we have chosen strategic goals which allow us to test the core concept and its feasibility</p>
</ul>
   
<h1>Design</h1>

<ul>
<h2><li>DNA probe</li></h2>
  <p>The purpose of our project in the BIOMOD competition isn’t to capture a payload of any medicinal value, but rather to prove the concept that a payload can be captured unbound inside of a DNA origami box which could potentially be modified to facilitate targeted delivery.</p>
<p>There a number of potential directions to take this project from here on. Some interesting avenues and opportunities include:</p>
  <p>Testing different brace-releasing mechanisms other than via endonuclease</p>
<p>Cutting the DNA brace with a restriction enzyme is only one way of releasing the pressure and capturing a payload. For example perhaps a binding event could take place in which the DNA in the brace binds to an accessory on the payload and thus stops supporting the lids causing the box to collapse.</p>

<p>This is worthwhile exploring as it may offer a more elegant solution with less or perhaps no modification to the payload of interest in order to capture it. Different variations of brace structures and receptors could exploit natural properties of the payload of interest to trigger selective closing.</p>

<h2><li>Chip</li></h2>
<p>Potential cargo release mechanisms</p>
<p>The next step is obviously to modify or design a new spring-loaded structure which can not only trap but also release the molecular payload. A couple of potential strategies include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Star activity of the endonuclease could eat out of the origami at body temperature. Perhaps the origami could be ingested in a frozen tablet to strategically time the degradation.</li>
  <li>Addition of surface receptors for internalisation of origami into T-cells or otherwise where the harsh environment will degrade the origami and release the payload.</li>
  <li>Reformation of the brace at the target site.</li>
  <li>Destruction of the hinge region to separate the lids.</li>
</ul>
