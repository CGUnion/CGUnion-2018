<h1>Abstract</h1>
<h2>Biomolecule-based nanostructures are of great interests in bio-nanomaterial design due to their rich structural diversity and inherent biocompatibility. Among them, cyclic peptides have received remarkable attention owing to their rigid configuration as well as chemical and enzymatic stability. To date, previous reports have mainly focused on the construction of nanotubes in a ring-stacking manner through hydrogen bonding. However, other assembling strategies have rarely been explored. In this work, two cyclic peptides, cyclo-(DP)3 and cyclo-(DG)3, have been rationally designed and used as building blocks to fabricate novel assemblies. Nanovesicles and nanotubes were successfully constructed by crosslinking cyclo-(DP)3 with hexamethylendiamine or cyclo-RR based on covalent bonding or electrostatic interaction. To further explore its potential application in nucleotide delivery, plasmid DNA and oligoRNA were successfully bound to the vesicles and the latter was taken into the cell. On the basis of this result, more complex functions, such as gene delivery and targeted siRNA delivery, are expected to achieve with these cyclic peptide assemblies.</h2>

  <h2><li>Background</li></h2>
  <h2>Building really small things is typically extremely hard; however since the development of the DNA origami technique a new world of opportunity has been opened. DNA origami allows scientists to relatively easily build arbitrary shapes and 3-dimensional structures on the nanoscale â€“ some examples of these are shown below.For more information of the DNA origami technique see DNA design. There are many applications for this technology; however one of the most interesting opportunities which emerged early on was the prospect of developing nanoscale vessels which could deliver molecular cargo. The series of events unfolds as follows: a vessel is loaded with the cargo, the vessel is delivered, and then a release mechanism unloads the cargo.DNA origami has been used to not only just capture and release cargo, but to autonomously target selective cells and release the contents directly to the target site via logic-gated mechanisms. </h2>
  <h2><li>The problem</li></h2>
  <h2>The process of targeted delivery can be broken down into three steps: loading the vessel with the drug of interest, recognising the target site, and releasing the payload directly at that site. As shown above with Douglas et al. and Ranjbar et al., effective vessels have already been developed, but thus far the method of loading the cargo is limited to chemically binding it to the vessel.

What if we could load a vessel with an unbound payload? So that when delivered rather than remaining attached to the vessel the cargo is free to diffuse out and perform its function. Would the free cargo be more effective compared to a bound cargo? Could it fit into smaller spaces and perform unique tasks that were previously unachievable due to being bound to the vessel?

  What if we could take it a step further and build a vessel which was selectively responsive to autonomously loading a particular cargo? Could that lay the foundation for a new generation of smart drug delivery vessels which can not only selectively unload their cargo, but can also identify free cargo in solution and load it?</h2>
