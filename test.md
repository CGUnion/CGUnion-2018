<h1>Abstract</h1>
<h2>Biomolecule-based nanostructures are of great interests in bio-nanomaterial design due to their rich structural diversity and inherent biocompatibility. Among them, cyclic peptides have received remarkable attention owing to their rigid configuration as well as chemical and enzymatic stability. To date, previous reports have mainly focused on the construction of nanotubes in a ring-stacking manner through hydrogen bonding. However, other assembling strategies have rarely been explored. In this work, two cyclic peptides, cyclo-(DP)3 and cyclo-(DG)3, have been rationally designed and used as building blocks to fabricate novel assemblies. Nanovesicles and nanotubes were successfully constructed by crosslinking cyclo-(DP)3 with hexamethylendiamine or cyclo-RR based on covalent bonding or electrostatic interaction. To further explore its potential application in nucleotide delivery, plasmid DNA and oligoRNA were successfully bound to the vesicles and the latter was taken into the cell. On the basis of this result, more complex functions, such as gene delivery and targeted siRNA delivery, are expected to achieve with these cyclic peptide assemblies.</h2>
